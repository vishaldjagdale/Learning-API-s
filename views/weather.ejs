            <h1>4. Weather App :</h1>

            <h3>Have You Ever Wondered how weather apps predict the weather? They don't have their own satellites but They do access some Weather API and display the results on their Apps.</h3>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Letâ€™s create our own Weather app. All we need is an API and a cool User Interface.</h3>
